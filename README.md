## About the extension

This extension is designed to help generate a README.md file for a project in Visual Studio Code. A README.md file is a common file found in software projects that provides information about the project, such as its purpose, how to use it, and any other relevant details.

With this extension, the user can select which directories to include in the README.md file and the extension will automatically generate a markdown file with a list of all the files and directories, along with any file descriptions that have been provided in the source code.

This extension was made using ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.
